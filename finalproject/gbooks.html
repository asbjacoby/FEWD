			<h3>Elvis and the Birth of Rock and Roll</h3>
			<h3>By Alfred Wertheimer</h3>
			<p>&quot;Elvis who?&quot; was photographer Alfred Wertheimer&rsquo;s response when, in early 1956, an RCA Victor publicist asked him to photograph an up-and-coming crooner from Memphis. Little did Wertheimer know that this would be the job of his life: just 21 years old, Presley was about to become a legend. Trailing Presley like a shadow, Wertheimer took nearly 3,000 photographs of Presley that year, creating a portrait of a man on the brink of superstardom. Now available as a TASCHEN standard edition, <em>Elvis and the Birth of Rock and Roll</em> collects Wertheimer&rsquo;s most remarkable shots from that magical year.</p>

			<h3>Soul Rebel: An Intimate Portrait of Bob Marley</h3>
			<h3>By David Burnett</h3>

Burnett&rsquo;s vision, coupled with Marley&rsquo;s larger-than-life charisma, resulted in an amazing collection of images. This stunning visual biography offers a rare look at Marley&rsquo;s personal life in Jamaica, as well as the exodus from his home country that culminated in his tragic death in 1981.</p>

			<h3>Patti Smith: American Artist</h3>
			<h3>By Frank Stefanko</h3>
			<p>Patti Smith was a favorite photographic subject for Frank Stefanko during college. &quot;Patti had jet-black hair and pale blue eyes that could see right through you. I was captivated by her look; tall, thin, with porcelain skin, sharp features, and those piercing eyes. With me, in terms of portraits, it&rsquo;s always the eyes first, then the rest of the face comes into view,&quot; Stefanko recalls.
			The intimate photographs capture the period of cultural change from the mid 1960s to the late 1970s. The book chronicles Smith&rsquo;s emergence as a writer, painter, singer-songwriter, performer, poet, mystic, and political activist.</p>

			<h3>Elvis at 21: From New York to Memphis</h3>
			<h3>By Alfred Wertheimer</h3>
			<p>With unimpeded access to the young performer in 1956, Alfred Wertheimer was able to capture the unguarded and everyday moments in Elvis&rsquo; life. Wertheimer&rsquo;s photographs of Elvis are extraordinary and he appears almost ethereal, whether reading a newspaper while waiting for a cab, or washing his hands during one of his many train trips. After Elvis&rsquo; induction into the army, the world seemingly forgot about Wertheimer&rsquo;s magical photographs for nineteen years, until Aug 16, 1977, the day Elvis died and Time Magazine called. &quot;The phone hasnâ€™t really stopped ringing in the last thirty years,&quot; said Wertheimer.</p>

			<h3>John &amp; Yoko: A New York Love Story</h3>
			<h3>By Allan Tannenbaum</h3>
			<p>In November 1980, on the eve of John Lennon&rsquo;s untimely murder, photographer Allan Tannenbaum had unique access to John and Yoko, who were emerging from five years of seclusion and avoiding the media. The resulting photographs portray a couple deeply in love--playful, spiritual, and remarkably at home in front of the camera while expressing their feelings to each other. John cherished these images of Yoko and was moved by their beauty and grace. This collection is both a celebration of and tribute to one of our greatest artists and an everlasting love affair.</p>

			<h3>The Lost Amazon: The Photographic Journey of Richard Evans Schultes</h3>
			<h3>By Wade Davis</h3>
			<p>Richard Evans Schultes may have been the greatest explorer of the Amazon and was regarded as the &quot;father of ethnobotany.&quot; Taking what was meant to be a short leave from Harvard in 1941, he surveyed the Amazon basin almost continuously for 12 years, during which time he lived among two dozen different Indian tribes, mapped rivers, sought sources of rubber for the US government during WWII, and collected and classified 30,000 botanical specimens, including 2,000 new medicinal plants. Schultes chronicled his stay in hundreds of remarkable photographs of the tribes and the land, evocative of the great documentary photographers such as Edward Sheriff Curtis.</p>
