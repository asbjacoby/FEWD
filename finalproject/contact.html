		<p>Since 1975, Govinda Gallery has established itself as one of the most innovative, contemporary galleries in the United States.   The gallery enjoyed a dynamic professional relationship with Andy Warhol for over fifteen years until the time of the his death.  Through its association with Warhol, Govinda came to know and exhibit many of the nation&rsquo;s leading pop artists during the late 70s and early 80s.</p> 

		<p>In 1984, Govinda Gallery hosted the first exhibition of the celebrated photographer Annie Leibovitz.  That exhibition featured Leibovitz&rsquo;s work as chief photographer for Rolling Stone magazine.   Since that time Govinda Gallery became the leading gallery in the world representing and exhibiting photographs related to contemporary music.</p>   

		<p>Govinda has organized over 200 major exhibitions of paintings, drawings, and photographs, many of which have traveled to museums and galleries across the U.S. and abroad including countries such as England, Mexico, Germany, Cuba, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Spain.</p>

		<p>Govinda Gallery director Christopher Murray is the author of over 16 books on photography and visual culture.</p>
		<p>Govinda Gallery left its public gallery space on 34th Street in 2011 after 35 years in Georgetown.  We currently operate out of private offices in the Palisades neighborhood and continue to organize exhibitions globally in addition to publishing fine art books.  The Govinda Gallery fine art photography collection is one of the largest in the world.  Sales are by appointment.</p>
